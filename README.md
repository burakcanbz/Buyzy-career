- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Concurrently** (installed automatically as a dev dependency)

---

## Installation

   git clone https://github.com/burakcanbz/Buyzy-career.git
   cd project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

   ```

---

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are defined in the `package.json` file for managing and running the project:

### **Start the backend server**
```bash
npm run server
```
- Runs the backend server using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server on file changes.
- Backend entry point: `api/app.js`.

### **Start the frontend client**
```bash
npm run client
```
- Starts the React development server.
- React entry point: `client/src/index.js`.

### **Run the project in development mode**
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Runs both the backend and frontend servers concurrently using the `concurrently` package.

### **Start the production server**
```bash
npm start
```
- Starts the backend server without `nodemon`.
- Note: Ensure the React app is built (`npm run build` in `client`).

---

### Running the Seeder Script
1. Ensure the backend server is properly configured and connected to the database.
2. Execute the `seeder.js` file:
3. 
   ```bash
   node api/seeder.js
   ```
4. This will read the user Template.json file from the data folder, hash the passwords, and populate the users.json file with the user data.
5. You can add any user data with the correct form to userTemplate.json file and populate them to users.json file using seeder.js fil.
---

## Admin Panel Features
- Admin users can be directed to the login page of Admin Panel to access the application with http://localhost:5000/admin-panel path.
- Only users with **admin accounts** can access the application.  
- Role-based access control to ensure security.  
- Unauthorized access is strictly prevented.  

## Running the Application

1. **Development Mode**:
   Use `npm run dev` to start both the backend and frontend servers.  
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5000` and API requests to the backend at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Production Mode**:
   Build the frontend for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build --prefix client
   ```
   Then start the backend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will serve the frontend static files and APIs from `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Key Points

- **Backend**:  
  The backend API is built with **Express.js**. Define routes in the `api/routes` folder and connect to your database in the `api/models` folder.

- **Frontend**:  
  The frontend is built with **React.js**. Create components in the `client/src` folder and manage state using **React hooks**/**redux**.
