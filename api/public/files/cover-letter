Dear Hiring Manager,
I'm a developer with hands-on experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python. I’ve built scalable systems using frameworks like React.js, Node.js, Flask. My main focus is on microservice architecture, event-driven systems, and reliable communication using Kafka and RabbitMQ.
I'm comfortable working with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I deploy services using Docker and CI/CD pipelines on AWS, GCP, and Firebase. I also prioritize testing (Jest, Supertest) and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) to ensure system reliability.
I’m a quick learner, solution-oriented, and eager to contribute to impactful projects. I’d be glad to be a part of your team.
Sincerely,
Burak Canbaz
